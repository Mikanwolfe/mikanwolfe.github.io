## Site

[nekox.net](https://nekox.net) is a personal porfolio site / blog for mikanwolfe, with modifications to the Moon theme.

The purpose of nekox.net is to distribute information and resources freely and openly, with posts centering around robotics engineering, projects, and software design. It does take quite a lot of work to write posts and pages -- and notably to upload images -- so it does take a little while to update posts.

The goal of nekox.net is to build a repository of knowledge and resources over time, with the goal of bringing more of the 'deeper end' of engineering, robotics, and software design to public light.

## Contact

If you have any questions, concerns, or queries, you can contact me via the [about page](https://nekox.net/about/) or through GitHub directly.
