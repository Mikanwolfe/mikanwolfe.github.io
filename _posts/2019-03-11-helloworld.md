## Finally!

It has always seemed like an odd choice for me to create my own website. My co-workers did urge me to create one for professionalism and contact's sake, but websites are expensive for a student. Often, hosting, purchasing a domain, and setting everything up, isn't easy. 

Welcome [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### GitHub Pages

GitHub pages is a service provided by GitHub to essentially create 'Project (web) Sites' for GitHub repositories. Each repository can host a static GitHub "Pages" (site) and each user/organisation is allowed a single personal site using the URL `username.github.io`. Of course, this can be changed easily to a custom domain. In my case, it was a simple case of adjusting some settings.

#### Google Domains

The domain 'nekox.net' I've purchased from Google Domains.

Google Domains provides simple and effective tools for domain management at a better price (for me, anyway) than other providers such as GoDaddy. Another reason why I decided to use Google Domains was integration with GSuite, Google's business offerings for GMail, Google Sheets, Google Drive, and the like. This made it easy to set up a custom email. For example, with the domain nekox.net, I could create an email called moon@nekox.net.
