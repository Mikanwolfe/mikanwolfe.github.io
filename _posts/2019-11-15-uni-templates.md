Report writing is commonplace within university -- especially within the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. To speed up the writing process and the overall quality of reports, we've devised templates that take into account common conventions and designs used by academics.

## The NKO Template

The NKO11 and NKO12 templates are 1 and 2 column templates respectively, containing a coversheet and content headers. The templats come with pre-arranged headings, and in the cast of 11.2, there are two types of heading formats. More details can be found in the templates themselves.
