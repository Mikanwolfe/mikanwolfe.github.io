In 2016, I was studying Systems Engineering Units 3/4 with my central project focusing on environmental impact. The challenge was to resolve issues of water quality in open bodies of water, notably, the tracking and assessment of water health and quality.

The resultant solution was a water-survey / water-quality / hydrology drone, *Zuihou*, after an aircraft carrier due to the design of the drone herself.
