### Systems Engineering

In 2016, I was studying Systems Engineering Units 3/4 with my central project focusing on environmental impact. The challenge was to resolve issues of water quality in open bodies of water, notably, the tracking and assessment of water health and quality.

The resultant solution was a water-survey / water-quality / hydrology drone, *Zuihou*, after an aircraft carrier due to the design of the drone herself.

### Melbourne Museums Top Designs

Every year, Melbourne Museum, located in Victoria, Australia, hosts an event *Top Designs*, highlighting the best work from several disciplines, such as Product Design, Fashion Design, and notably, Systems Engineering. Of the thousands of students that apply, only about 10 are selected as Exhibitors, with three that are interviewed.

## Highlights

* Powered by an Arduino-Compatible Freetronics EtherTen board
* Programmed in C++ using the Arduino IDE
* Two sensors built from the ground up: Salinity and Turbidity
* Sensors are housed in 3D printed  enclosures and mounts
* Entire system is mounted within a boat, capable of remote control
