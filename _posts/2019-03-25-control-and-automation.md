A lot of mathematics goes into Control Systems Engineering. The following post will only be a brief summary of certain concepts related to Control and Automation of such systems and no attempt will be made to justify or clarify anything written here. For further reading, check out <u>Modern Control Engineering</u> by Katsuhiko Ogata.

## Mason's gain


$$
P  = \frac{1}{\Delta}\sum_kP_k \Delta_k
$$
