nekox.net was originally intended to be a static, one-page contact-me webpage, but has evolved into a portfolio website. Utilising the Moon Theme by [Taylantatli](https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/), the challenges have focused around understanding Jekyll and the entire development process.

## Highlights

* nekox.net is hosted through GitHub pages.
* nekox.net utilises the Moon Theme and Jekyll to generate static webpages that are served to anyone connecting to `https://nekox.net/`


## Static Webpages and Github Pages Hosting

Compared to website providers, hosting via GitHub Pages is a much more involved process. 

Limited to only static web pages, GitHub Pages offers free hosting from a repository directly, only requiring pushes to the repository itself to push changes to the site. This is done through Jekyll, a static site engine of sorts. Jekyll takes content from a markdown file (.md) and converts it to a series of HTML webpages for hosting. With additional information in the header, Jekyll is able to create rather impressive webpages with relatively little back-end. These files are written and pushed to `_posts` at the [nekox repository](https://github.com/Mikanwolfe/mikanwolfe.github.io)
