# Mechatronics Project: Robotic Arm

**Part 1**

This is the pilot post for what'll hopefully be a series in the production process of a mechatronics project. Mechatronics Systems Design (MSD) is a project-based unit aimed at  developing a deeper understanding of integrated mechanical-electronic  (mechatronic) systems. This project involves three main disciplines:  Mechanical, Electronic, and Control Systems Engineering.

Despite the lack of a better name the Robotic Arm Project aims to have  students develop and manufacture a Pick-and-Place Robotic arm within  the constraints of the use of DC Motor, Sensor, and the Microcontroller  (specifically PLC, or Programmable Logic Controller) provided. This task  aims to consolidate the understanding of Modern Control System Theory,  such as PID controllers and the feedback process to complete both the basic and advanced requirements.

## The Beginning

`TODO: fix this slightly for a better structure`

Sometimes it takes a lot of understanding to recognise something as hard. Not knowing how difficult this project *might* end up being could cost us a lot of time in the long run, so some preparation is key.

Having established a group, the first few steps are simple: establish:

* A group-chat of some sort
* A shared folder (Google drive tends to work well)

In addition, I've also created:

* A Trello board and team with invite links
* A GitHub repository.

Of course, a blank folder or repository won't help much. A set workflow is important -- Folders on the cloud drive and the Trello board are arranged with a "To Do / Doing / Done" sequence. Though it is useful to separate items into their subgroups (such as one for chassis or one for "code"), items can get lost quickly and things can be left unfinished. Having trialled both systems, I've personally found the TD/D/D setup to work more effectively as it ensures that no rock is unturned and collects all the resources to "do one thing" into one subfolder, reducing both the amount of clutter and searching any one person has to go through to perform a task.

## Overview of Task

### Requirements

### Constraints

**Notably the construction methods:** Laser Cut MDF, however, there'll be a wait and only a one-ish time allowance to cut an A3 sheet. 

I personally own a 3D printer that's been gathering dust so the following post should include the set-up and adjusting parameters for Cura and the few test prints I performed.



## Setting up 3D Printing
