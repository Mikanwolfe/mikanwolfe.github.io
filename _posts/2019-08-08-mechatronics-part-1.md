# Mechatronics Project: Robotic Arm

**Part 1**

This is the pilot post for what'll hopefully be a series in the production process of a mechatronics project. Mechatronics Systems Design (MSD) is a project-based unit aimed at  developing a deeper understanding of integrated mechanical-electronic  (mechatronic) systems. This project involves three main disciplines:  Mechanical, Electronic, and Control Systems Engineering.

Despite the lack of a better name the Robotic Arm Project aims to have  students develop and manufacture a Pick-and-Place Robotic arm within  the constraints of the use of DC Motor, Sensor, and the Microcontroller  (specifically PLC, or Programmable Logic Controller) provided. This task  aims to consolidate the understanding of Modern Control System Theory,  such as PID controllers and the feedback process to complete both the basic and advanced requirements.

## Overview

The Robotic Arm Project is to be completed in a group of 2-3 students and requires the construction, programming, and demonstration of a specific scenario. The breakdown of the project is as follows:

* Oral Presentation (10%)
* Project Demonstration (20%)
* Project final Report (20%)

The total contribution will be 50% of our final mark.

### Personal Portfolio

Each student will be required to complete a personal design folio worth 20% of the final mark. Despite the name, the folio will be similar to a report, containing design requirements, literature reviews, and a design section alongside system modelling calculations.

As such, this blog-post series will be the slightly less formal, full design process outlining the progress and possible decisions in a more laid-out manner.

### Scenario and Demonstration

The robotic arm is to be constructed to move "components" from a loading bay to an unloading bay, spaced 150mm apart with a 2-second stop in-between to simulate a need to 'scan' the component.

The evaluations will be based on the following criteria:

* The amount of components delivered in a set amount of time;
* The performance and reliability of the system, notably with the advanced requirements of a 200mm transfer distance and a manual control mode.

### Constraints

There are a limited number of components available which limit the design of the robotic arm to a single axis of movement. Furthermore, the methods of manufacture available to students are also limited, notably one (1) attempt at laser-cutting on an MDF sheet as the construction for the arm itself.

## The Beginning

This marks the beginning of the more casual blog post series that should show the process of creating a basic robotic arm!

First thing's first: Getting started with groupwork tools. 

* Google Drive (or OneDrive)
* Trello
* GitHub

The basic workflow is as follows:

*Any resources goes in subfolders!*

The goal of this sort of system is to keep resources and tasks organised. This is important because once we introduce more file types, things can get lost quickly. By organising *everything* we need for a specific task under a folder, we can hopefully ensure that task resources don't get lost as easily. Will report later how well this system works.

## 3D Printing!!

From my [Hydrology Drone Project](https://github.com/Mikanwolfe/Hydrology-Drone-Zuiho), I had a 3D printer that was gathering a shocking amount of dust and was in dire need of some maintenance. The model of 3D printer was a really basic one from *ALDI's CocoonCreate*, launched in Australia some 4-5 years ago retailing for about \$400AUD (~\$271US).

Since the software was a bit outdated, there were a few kinks to work out before I could fully utilise my 3D printer for this project.

More to come!

* The 3D printer had some filament stuck inside, I should've taken some pictures...
* Filament is a bit old (exposed to air for 9+ months), so it's _reaaally_ brittle compared to normal filament
* Cura 'Lulzbot' edition v.s. current edition of Cura! Results!
