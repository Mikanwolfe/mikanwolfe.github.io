### Design Patterns

When we have a problem, as engineers, we find solutions. Often, there are smarter people who have had the exact same or very similar problems and thus, have also found solutions. More often than not, their solutions are often a lot better than what we could produce in our limited time we have to deal with the problem, be it a technical or temporal constraint. 

The entire idea behind frameworks and standard libraries is to save time for us measly programmers as they provide solutions for common problems. The concept of design patterns extends this to the more abstract domain.

Design patterns are programming are used to address common problems that come up when developing an Object-Oriented (OO)-solution. The fundemental framework of OO Design patterns are the 23 by the Gang of Four (GoF). 

Divided into three categories, the patterns are:

- **Creational Patterns**
  - Abstract Factory
  - Builder
  - Factory Method
  - Protype
  - Singleton
- **Structural Patterns**
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy
- **Behavioural Patterns**
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Command
  - Interpreter
  - Iterator
  - Mediator
  - Memento
  - Observer
  - State
  - Strategy
  - Template Method
  - Visitor

Yes, there are a lot of them but it's something to work on.

These are my notes when it comes to this topic, as I'm learning with you, I can't say for certain if any or everything of what I say is even remotely correct, other than citing sources incorrectly. If I make a mistake, please don't get mad, I'm just a simple engineering student trying to make ends. Comment down below if something's off and I'll do my best to fix issues as they arise.
