## A note on "nekox"

"nekox" is an amalgamation of my laptop's device name: **Neko**mimi Cooperative Ape**x** 15, and is therefore pronounced "Neko-Eks".

Nekox.net is powered by the lovely Moon theme by [TaylanTatli](https://github.com/TaylanTatli). Moon is licensed under the MIT license but Tatli deserves a lot more than a simple mention. My heartfelt thanks goes out to Tatli for creating such an amazing theme.
