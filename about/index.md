## A note on "nekox"

The name 'nekox' in the context of this site, 'nekox.net', refers to content created by Mikanwolfe with derivative names such as "Nekox Systems" and "Nekox Industries" as fictional characters and is, in no way, shape or form, related to any real-life figures or companies. A good example of the name 'nekox' used in works is the *nekox-fingerprinter*, or similar works.

"nekox" is an amalgamation of my laptop's device name: **Neko**mimi Cooperative Ape**x** 15, and is therefore pronounced "Neko-Eks".

## Theme

Nekox.net is powered by the lovely Moon theme by [TaylanTatli](https://github.com/TaylanTatli). Moon is licensed under the MIT license but Tatli deserves a lot more than a simple mention. My heartfelt thanks goes out to Tatli for creating such an amazing theme.
