**Welcome to nekox.net!**

Mikanwolfe is an Engineering (Robotics)/Computer Science (Software) student currently studying at Swinburne University of Techonolgy* in Melbourne, Australia.

## Theme

Nekox.net is powered by the lovely Moon theme by [TaylanTatli](https://github.com/TaylanTatli). Moon is licensed under the MIT license but Tatli deserves a lot more than a simple mention. My heartfelt thanks goes out to Tatli for creating such an amazing theme.
