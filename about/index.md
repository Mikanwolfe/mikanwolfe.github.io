# nekox.net

**Welcome to nekox.net!**

Stylised `nekox`, nekox.net is a portfolio website for Mikan "Mikanwolfe" Kikuchi (T. J.)

Mikanwolfe is an Engineering (Robotics)/Computer Science (Software) student currently studying at *Swinburne University of Technology* in Melbourne, Australia. Currently a third-year student, Mikanwolfe is the recipient of the Vice-Chancellor's Excellence Scholarship and was awarded the New Colombo Plan (NCP) Scholarship as part of the Future Leaders Program.

Mikanwolfe has interned at Risked-Based Authentication provider *Caulis Inc.* in Japan, and was a exhibitor at Melbourne Museum's Top Designs 2017 with a Water Survey Drone.

Mikanwolfe is currently the Secretary of the Swinburne Mechatronics Engineering Society.



## A note on "nekox"

The name 'nekox' in the context of this site, 'nekox.net', refers to content created by Mikanwolfe with derivative names such as "Nekox Systems" and "Nekox Industries" as fictional characters and is, in no way, shape or form, related to any real-life figures or companies. A good example of the name 'nekox' used in works is the *nekox-fingerprinter*, or similar works.

"nekox" is an amalgamation of my laptop's device name: **Neko**mimi Cooperative Ape**x** 15, and is therefore pronounced "Neko-Eks".

## Theme

Nekox.net is powered by the lovely Moon theme by [TaylanTatli](https://github.com/TaylanTatli). Moon is licensed under the MIT license but Tatli deserves a lot more than a simple mention. My heartfelt thanks goes out to Tatli for creating such an amazing theme.
